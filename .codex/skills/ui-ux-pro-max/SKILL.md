# UI/UX Pro Max — Design Intelligence

Comprehensive UX/UI guidance for web and mobile. Covers 10 rule categories: accessibility, touch & interaction, performance, style, layout, typography & color, animation, forms & feedback, navigation, and data visualization. Applied with priority weighting — fix CRITICAL first, HIGH second, MEDIUM third.

---

## When to Apply

### Must Use
- Designing new pages (landing, dashboard, admin, SaaS, mobile app)
- Creating or refactoring UI components (buttons, modals, forms, tables, charts)
- Choosing color schemes, typography, spacing, or layout systems
- Reviewing UI code for accessibility, visual consistency, or UX quality
- Implementing navigation, animations, or responsive behavior
- Making product-level design decisions (style, hierarchy, brand)

### Recommended
- UI looks "unprofessional" but the reason is unclear
- Receiving feedback on usability or experience
- Pre-launch UI quality pass
- Aligning cross-platform design (Web / iOS / Android)
- Building design systems or reusable component libraries

### Skip
- Pure backend logic, API/database design, DevOps, infrastructure, non-visual scripts

**Decision rule**: If the task changes how something *looks, feels, moves, or is interacted with* — use this skill.

---

## How to Use

**Step 1 — Analyze requirements**
Identify: product type, target audience, style keywords, tech stack.

**Step 2 — Apply the rule categories below** in priority order (1→10). Focus on CRITICAL and HIGH first.

**Step 3 — Run the Pre-Delivery Checklist** before submitting any UI code.

| Scenario | Start From |
|---|---|
| New project / page | Step 1 → Style Selection → Layout → Typography |
| New component | Animation + Forms + Interaction rules |
| Review existing UI | Quick Reference checklist, §1–§3 first |
| Fix a UI bug | Relevant section from Quick Reference |
| Improve / optimize | §3 Performance + §5 Layout |
| Add charts / data viz | §10 Charts & Data |

- `back-behavior` — Back navigation predictable, consistent, preserves scroll/state
- `deep-linking` — All key screens reachable via deep link / URL
- `nav-label-icon` — Navigation items have both icon and text label; icon-only hurts discoverability
- `nav-state-active` — Current location visually highlighted (color, weight, indicator)
- `nav-hierarchy` — Primary nav (tabs/bottom bar) vs secondary nav (drawer) clearly separated
- `modal-escape` — Modals offer clear close affordance; swipe-down to dismiss on mobile
- `search-accessible` — Search reachable from top bar or tab; recent/suggested queries provided

- `back-stack-integrity` — Never silently reset nav stack or jump to home unexpectedly
- `avoid-mixed-patterns` — Don't mix Tab + Sidebar + Bottom Nav at the same hierarchy level
- `modal-vs-navigation` — Modals not for primary navigation flows; they break the user's path
- `persistent-nav` — Core navigation reachable from deep pages; don't hide in sub-flows

### §10 Charts & Data (LOW)

- `chart-type` — Match chart type to data: trend → line, comparison → bar, proportion → pie/donut
- `color-guidance` — Accessible palettes; avoid red/green-only pairs for colorblind users
- `data-table` — Provide table alternative; charts alone are not screen-reader friendly

- `legend-visible` — Always show legend; position near chart
- `tooltip-on-interact` — Hover (Web) / tap (mobile) tooltips with exact values
- `axis-labels` — Label axes with units; no truncated or rotated labels on mobile

- `empty-data-state` — Meaningful empty state with guidance; not a blank chart
- `loading-chart` — Skeleton/shimmer while chart data loads
- `animation-optional` — Chart entrance animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
- `large-dataset` — Aggregate or sample 1000+ data points; provide drill-down
- `touch-target-chart` — Interactive chart elements ≥44pt tap area

## Common Rules for Professional UI

### Icons & Visual Elements

| Rule | Do | Don't |
|---|---|---|
| No emoji as icons | Use SVG icons (Lucide, Heroicons, etc.) | Navigation icons as emojis (🎨🚀⚙️) |
| Vector-only assets | SVG / platform vector icons | Raster PNG icons that blur |
| Consistent icon sizing | Define tokens: icon-sm / icon-md (24pt) / icon-lg | Random 20 / 24 / 28pt mixing |
| Stroke consistency | One stroke width per visual layer (1.5px or 2px) | Mixing thick/thin strokes |
| Filled vs outline discipline | One style per hierarchy level | Mixing filled and outline at same level |
| Touch target minimum | ≥44×44pt; use `hitSlop` if icon is smaller | Small icons without expanded hit area |
| Icon alignment | Align to text baseline; consistent padding | Misaligned icons or inconsistent spacing |
| Icon contrast | 4.5:1 (small) / 3:1 (large UI glyphs) | Low-contrast icons blending into background |

### Interaction Standards

| Rule | Do | Don't |
|---|---|---|
| Tap feedback | Visual response within 80–150ms (ripple/opacity/elevation) | No visual response on tap |
| Animation timing | Micro-interactions 150–300ms with platform-native easing | Instant transitions or >500ms animations |
| Accessibility focus | Screen reader focus order matches visual; labels descriptive | Unlabeled controls or confusing traversal |
| Disabled state | Reduced opacity (0.38–0.5) + cursor change + semantic attribute | Controls that look tappable but do nothing |
| Touch target minimum | ≥44×44pt iOS / ≥48×48dp Android; expand hit area | Tiny touch targets without padding |
| Semantic controls | Native interactive primitives with proper roles | Generic containers as controls without semantics |

### Light/Dark Mode

| Rule | Do | Don't |
|---|---|---|
| Surface readability (light) | Cards/surfaces clearly separated with opacity/elevation | Overly transparent surfaces that blur hierarchy |
| Text contrast (light) | Body text ≥4.5:1 against light surfaces | Low-contrast gray body text |
| Text contrast (dark) | Primary ≥4.5:1; secondary ≥3:1 on dark surfaces | Dark mode text that blends into background |
| Token-driven theming | Semantic color tokens mapped per theme | Hardcoded hex values per screen |
| Scrim and modal legibility | Modal scrim 40–60% black to isolate foreground | Weak scrim that leaves background competing |
| State contrast parity | Pressed/focused/disabled equally distinguishable in both themes | Interaction states defined for one theme only |

### Layout & Spacing

| Rule | Do | Don't |
|---|---|---|
| Safe-area compliance | Respect top/bottom safe areas for fixed headers, tab bars, CTA bars | UI placed under notch, status bar, or gesture area |
| 8dp spacing rhythm | Consistent 4/8dp spacing system for padding, gaps, section spacing | Random spacing increments with no rhythm |
| Consistent content width | Predictable content width per device class | Arbitrary widths between screens |
| Section spacing hierarchy | Vertical rhythm tiers: 16 / 24 / 32 / 48 by hierarchy | Similar UI levels with inconsistent spacing |
| Scroll and fixed coexistence | Content insets so lists don't hide behind fixed bars | Scroll content obscured by sticky headers/footers |

## Stacking with frontend-design

This skill covers **UX rules and interaction quality**. The `frontend-design` skill covers **aesthetic direction and visual identity**. Use both together:

1. `frontend-design` → aesthetic direction, type system, color palette, signature element
2. `ui-ux-pro-max` → accessibility, interaction quality, animation timing, layout rules, pre-delivery checks
